<h1>About Mapola FC Academy</h1>
<p>
    Marcus Laquie established the Mapola FC Academy in 2012 as a Not-For-Profit -Organization to serve young players in the culturally diverse demographic of the greater Toronto area. The establishment of Mapola FC Academy in the GTA gives parents the soccer opportunity they have long been seeking for their children. After some forward-thinking about soccer programs in our community, Marcus came to the conclusion that youth in the GTA needed structural program with dedicated, progressive, and committed coaching staff that has the quality to teach and make impact on her  participants development. Marcus thought about creating an environment that will provide a fun atmosphere, focused on holistic child development, including emotional, physiological, social, cultural, physical and mental. Consistent development of the physical capacities such as body coordination, agility, fast reaction, flexibility and elasticity aid in athletes’ development approach to the game of soccer.

    Our primary goal is to provide a platform for players to develop rapidly and be identified. We strive to ensure that players develop at a faster pace through the Mapola FC Academy system by playing against the best competition. Players will learn to excel in a pressurized environment, which should help in preparing players to take the Canadian game to the next level. Our system provides the opportunity for players to compete in top-level soccer throughout the year. We believe that every player is capable of improving his or her overall soccer performance. We are committed to providing the instruction and support to give our players the best opportunity to reach their potential, regardless of age or level. All of our players deserve the opportunity to improve their overall soccer performance, in a manner that is relevant to their potential. This includes increasing their technical skill sets and their understanding of basic tactical relationships, (1v1 to 4v4), and improving their fitness level and their willingness to compete.

<p>We believe that youth sports programs encourage and promote healthy strong kids, families and communities by placing a priority on family involvement, healthy competition rather than rivalry, the value of participation over winning, team building as well as individual development, a positive self-image and a sense of fair play and mutual respect for others. Given Brampton's culturally diverse demographic, challenges arise on how to bond everyone together. One vehicle to overcome these challenges is the continued use of Sports to unite our youth into one cohesive unit. One example of a sport, which embraces our goal, is soccer. As a team sport, soccer promotes fairness and tolerance. The game helps to overcome barriers between the sexes, facilitate mutual understanding, and contribute towards positive personality and character development. It provides lessons in strategies of peaceful debate, nurtures the ability to handle defeat and shapes personality. We look to utilize the social and educational potential of soccer
and sport in general for youth development. We encourage socially isadvantaged young girls and boys in such a way that they are able to take charge of their own lives and shape them in a positive manner.

    As stated earlier, communities are being burdened with a continued increase in obesity among the youth. Clinical studies also show that sports and recreation programs can help youth establish lifelong, healthy, physical activity patterns. Regular physical activity can ward off life-threatening diseases; reduce feelings of depression and anxiety; help control weight and obesity; and build and maintain healthy bones, muscles, and joints, according to the Council on Physical Fitness. We use the convening power of sports as a vehicle to minimize the effects of poverty on marginalized youth and young adult populations. Through sports, we are able to bring individuals from all backgrounds and social statuses together in a relaxed and natural environment that is ideal for exploring serious and sensitive issues. We believe that sports instill the critical “can do” outlook that is vital to a child’s successful educational development. And, we believe in the power of sport to create lasting individual and social change. Sport is helping young people to claim space, build self-esteem, develop leadership skills and strengthen social relationships. Sport and sport-based programs promote leadership, teamwork, critical thinking, networking, negotiation skills and enhance youth empowerment.
